Mast Part 3 
st10479623

## Project Overview 
Christoffels Cooking Menu App is a React Native application that allows cooks to simply manage a restaurant menu.
 The software allows the chef to add, view as well as  remove meals while also providing customers with the ability to filter menu items by course.
 This version improves and builds on the logic and layout established in Part 2 with better organization, functionality and design.

 ## Change Log 
 ### Refactoring and Code Structure
Split the original single screen layout into three separate screens which are as follows: 

Home Screen: Displays complete menu, total count, and average prices.

Add Item Screen: Allows the chef  to input dish details such as name, description, course and price.

Filter Screen: allows the customer to filter menu items by course.

Implemented React Navigation Stack Navigator to manage multi screen navigation cleanly.

Improved state management by storing menu items in an array shared across screens.

### New Added Features 
Added average price per course calculation on the Home Screen.

Added ability to remove items directly from the Add Item screen.

Implemented filter functionality to view dishes by selected course on the Filter Screen.

Menu data dynamically updates across all screens. 

## User Interface Improvements 
Introduced a table style layout for organized display of dishes for the home page.

Polished visuals with an elegant black and gold theme for a refined appearance.

Improved spacing, alignment as well as  text readability for better presentation.

Simplified button and input field styling for a consistent modern interface.
