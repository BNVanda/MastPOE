## Project Overview 
Christoffels Cooking Menu App is a React Native application that allows cooks to simply manage a restaurant menu.
 The software allows the chef to add, view as well as  remove meals while also providing customers with the ability to filter menu items by course.
 This version improves and builds on the logic and layout established in Part 2 with better organization, functionality and design.
